# Examples for SUREFIRE-2254

This a small maven project showcasing the content of the XML report generated by [Apache Maven Surefire Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)
when JUnit tests print to standard out/err. The project aims to address the questions raised in [SUREFIRE-2254](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-2254)
with respect to what events write to standard out/err when tests are skipped.

Run the test.
```
mvn test
```
Check the content of generated XML file
```
less target/surefire-reports/TEST-TestPrintSystemOutErrWithSkippedTests.xml
```

The most interesting/problematic case (but not the only one) is when tests are skipped with the `Assume` API cause
then all standard out/err from `@Before` and `@After` methods is saved in the XML report.

```xml
 <testcase name="testWithAssumeBeforePrint" classname="TestPrintSystemOutErrWithSkippedTests" time="0.0">
    <skipped message="Skip with assume"/>
    <system-out><![CDATA[Hello I am method setupTest
Hello I am method tearTest
]]></system-out>
    <system-err><![CDATA[Hello I am method setupTest
Hello I am method tearTest
]]></system-err>
  </testcase>
```
